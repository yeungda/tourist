todo for showing to someone
* gemify
* clear README
* make it support custom matchers

todo for something releasable
* easy project initialisation
* single command for describe, run, verify, etc

todo
* observe state change time
** think this will require an analysis step, for map/reduce on observations.yaml
* write a build script
* return -1 when verify fails
* add descriptions to journeys

wishlist 
* parallel journey support
* overall journey time expectation
* save files outside of observations.yaml
* print how many expectations not matching anything
* coverage graph generation
* exploratory testing and development
  * REPL
  * web based UI for controlling journey
* add exception when target name clash detected
* error message when location defined twice (i wasted several minutes because of this)
* good error messages for misuse of dsl?

questions
* are observers creating too much data?
* stages of journeys for better clarity?
* sub states?
